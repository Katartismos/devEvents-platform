## About

DevEvents is a web application designed to help developers
discover and track upcoming developer‑focused events (hackathons,
meetups, conferences, online/hybrid events) from around the world, in
one centralized space. Users can browse featured events, view event
details, and --- depending on permissions --- create new event listings.

The project features a lightweight, easy-to-use "event hub" for
dev communities, helping developers stay informed of events relevant to
them no matter where they are.
